    "- \"The firm **Caveon Test Security** specializes in what it describes as '**Data Forensics**' to find patterns that suggest cheating . . . when . . . the test takers get an answer wrong, they should not all consistently have the same wrong answer. If they do it suggests that they are copying from one another or sharing answers. . .  The company looks for exams in which a test takerdoes significantly better on hard questions than easy questions (suggesting they had the answers in advance) and for exams on which the number of 'wrong to right' erasures is significantly higher than the number of 'right to wrong' erasures (suggesting a teacher or administrator changed the answer sheets after the test).\" (Naked Statistics p 8)\n",
